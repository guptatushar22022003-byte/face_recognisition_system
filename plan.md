# Face Recognition System Plan

## Objective
Build a system to recognize faces using Python.

## Proposed Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `face_recognition`: For state-of-the-art face recognition.
  - `opencv-python`: For video capture and image processing.
  - `numpy`: For array manipulations.

## Questions for User
1. **Interface**: Do you prefer a Web App (Flask/Streamlit) or a Desktop Window (OpenCV GUI)?
2. **Input**: Webcam feed or Static Images?
3. **Features**: Attendance logging, simple identification, or security alert?

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies.
2. Create `faces` directory for known people.
3. Write the recognition script.
